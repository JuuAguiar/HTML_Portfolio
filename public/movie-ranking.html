  A children's movie in which the songs are currently on repeat on my Spotify.
  <br />

<p>
  A marvelous work of art directed by James Cameron. The entire movie keeps you
  invested<br />
  in the story. With breathtaking scenes and an involving script, the two hours
  movie seems to pass in the blink of an eye
</p>

<h3>Star Wars: Return of the Jedi</h3>

  A classic from the theaters. The Return of the Jedi completes the Hero's
  Journey of Luke Skywalker <br />
  putting an end to the Original Triology of the saga with a compelling end.
