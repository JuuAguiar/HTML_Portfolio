<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Julia. I am a young woman in my 20's, currently living in Brazil, and studying for my degree in Computer Science on UNA. <br>
  I aquired Dr. Angela's bootcamp a week ago expecting to learn how to code and start my career as a jr fullstack dev once I finish it. </p>
<p>In my free time, I enjoy reading, playing video games, and watch few movies be it on Netflix or Disney +. </p>
